L03 Lab for ITAI 1378

This lab goes over first creating a GitHub account to make a repository for the lesson.
After creating the repository we are to install Python and Jupyter Notebook & JupyterLab.
Upon launching the tool I am to create a new notebook to run a simple Python script.
Lastly, upload the notebook file to the repository and write a report.
